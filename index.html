    <section id="Reason">
        <h2>Reason why I joined Altschool Africa</h2>
        <p>Observing the world in this digital age, I discovered that all profession must have their base in 
            tech in order to reach the global world. This has prompted me to delve into the tech field.
            Choosing a niche was really hard for me because there were so many option. I went for frontend
            engineering because i heard it was quite tasking. There is a saying among the yorubas 
            "where the going get tough you meet the men"
        </p>
    <p>
        I was pondering on an institution to make my dream of becoming a software engineer come to fruition.
        I finally discuss it with my friend, a cyber securist. He then reccommended Altschool and other 
        institutions. After accessing the institutions websites and social pages,
    I was impressed by the content of Altschool Africa. The duration and ease of learning at one's pace in combination 
    with my work schedule excite me.

        will be taught in Altschool of engineering to:  become a renown software engineer, cooperate with fellow software engineer in tackling problems, reach the global world
